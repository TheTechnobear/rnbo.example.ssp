TEMP FILE - just so I dont forget steps for MAIN build doc


# log on to build machine

```
ssh user@build.local
```

# make sure we have tools we need

for linux 
```
sudo apt install cmake git llvm clang g++-10-arm-linux-gnueabihf 
```


(although this is v10 of g++ others will likely work)



note: some distros may combine llvm and clang, some may not... 
check clang is present after install!

for macOS (using homebrew)
```
brew install cmake git llvm 
```
(some installs may need arm-linux-gnueabihf-binutils, gcc-arm-embedded)



# setup requirements for build

buildroot
```
mkdir ~/buildroot
cd ~/buildroot
scp  user@host~/Downloads/arm-rockchip-linux-gnueabihf_sdk-buildroot.tar.gz  .
tar xzf arm-rockchip-linux-gnueabihf_sdk-buildroot.tar.gz
```

vst sdk (v3)
```
mkdir ~/SDKs
cd ~/SDKs
tar xzf arm-rockchip-linux-gnueabihf_sdk-buildroot.tar.gz
```

note: expecting SDK in $HOME/SDKs/vst3-sdk", though it can be overriden


# build project
now we can finally build the sdk project 

first we need to grab it from git

```
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/TheTechnobear/ssp-sdk.git
cd ssp-sdk/
git checkout tb-v3
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
(note: url/branch changes for release)


now lets build 

```
cd examples
mkdir build 
cd build
export BUILDROOT=~/buildroot/arm-rockchip-linux-gnueabihf_sdk-buildroot
```



create cmake files

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../xcSSP.cmake .. 
```

note: if this fails, e.g due to not finding something, delete entire build directory contents before trying again.
as it caches details, and failing to delete will get confusing results ! 


now the actual build 

```
cmake --build . -v -- -j 4
```

note: -j 4 , means use 8 cores, you can adjust according to number of cores on your build machine

resuls are something like: 
- ./api/test/libtest.so
- ./QVCA_artefacts/Release/VST3/qvca.vst3/Contents/armv7l-linux/qvca.so



note you could edit examples/CMakeLists if you dont want to build the vst



# local testing (not on ssp) 

if you want to build for your local machine (e.g. to test the VST locally) rather than the SSP.
this is SO simple :) 

we simply dont use the TOOLCHAIN make file so 

rather than:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../xcSSP.cmake .. 
```

we use:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. 
```

if you do these in different build directories ( e.g. build.spp and build.local) 
then you can simply do the above once in each build directory...
from then on , you simply change to the directory you want to build (local or ssp) 
and say 
```
cmake --build . -v -- -j 4
```
